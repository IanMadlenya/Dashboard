# Dashboard

This dashboard helps us focus on the KPIs (key performance indicators) we agreed are integral to the growth of wealthbot.

Specifically:

* The number of forks to wealthbot.io/core
* The number of times we've implemented wealthbot at enterprise levels
* The number of people subscribed to our mailing list (indicator of interest)
